# Shakespeare Soup

Java Web App to formulate sentences using directed graphs and Shakespeare's timeless works!

Head to http://shakespearesoup.org/ to see it in action

Just enter in a root word and this tool will create a sentence or phrase beginning with you word.

Some of these phrases may come out as pure gibberish but it is all for [romantic]comedies sake.

This was created using directed graphs as a way to better understand there usage and structure.

## Setup

Apache tomcat 7 is needed - https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi.

I created everything using Eclipse.
